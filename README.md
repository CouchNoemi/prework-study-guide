# <Usage of Programming languages>

## Description

My motivation to do this project is indagating, learning, studying,  and practicing programming languages as well as getting familiar with web developing platforms, challenging my logical thinking skills, and improving my creativity and critical thinking.
I built this project intending to establish a way to keep all the information learned at the bootcamp visually and easily to find.
This project resolves the organizational inquiry and performs better on this learning path since it makes a projection of specific educational content and subtracts every piece of information to simplify it and make it uncomplicated to understand 
I learned the best way to execute every programming language used during the pre-work and combine programming tools to obtain a better result on the final product, I also practiced the process of submitting my work to the GitHub platform furthermore terms used in the web developing world and comprehend the function of every line of code.
